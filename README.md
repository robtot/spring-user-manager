# Getting Started

Demo application for managing users in PostgreSQL database. Uses Java Spring as backend and React in frontend.

### Running locally

The simplest way to run this application locally is with docker-compose. It will serve the application at localhost:8080.

Alternatively, you can run the Spring server, React dev server (in frontend folder) and PostgreSQL all manually on your computer. You will need to configure Spring to access the local database as well. You can check the docker files for what versions to use.
